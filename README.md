# Portfolio

This is a portfolio project created by **Dad**: **Kaushik Rana** as a gift.

## Overview

I used TypeScript with Next.js to give it a try. The main focus of this project is on the user interface (UI). 

My dad wanted a professor-style portfolio UI rather than a typical developer look.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Ant Design (AntD)**
- **ShadCN UI**
- **Cloudinary** for image hosting
- **Firebase** for authentication and storage

## Features

- A clean, professor-style UI
- High-quality images
- Smooth transitions and responsive design

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
